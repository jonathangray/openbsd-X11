	* Imakefile, TODO: Added TODO file for listing potential future
	projects within x11-ssh-askpass.

	* README: Added 'make install.man' to installation instructions. 
	Formulated better wording for reference to (now ancient) Perl/Tk
	ssh-askpass.

2000-08-28 07:26  jmknoble

	* Imakefile, x11-ssh-askpass.man.in: Added facilities to Imakefile
	and man page to automatically insert name, date, and version into
	man page.  Changed install target to include man page.	Rearranged
	clean and dist targets slightly.  Ready for release.

2000-08-28 06:54  jmknoble

	* x11-ssh-askpass.man.in: Added corrections and clarifications: 
	Mentioned optional label on command line; noted which toolkit
	options are unsupported; and added extra indicator-specific
	resources.

2000-08-28 06:00  jmknoble

	* x11-ssh-askpass.c: Moved saving of argc/argv to after call to
	XtAppInitialize(), so that toolkit arguments get properly removed
	from the argument list.

2000-08-28 05:42  jmknoble

	* x11-ssh-askpass.man.in: Changed author email address from
	pobox.com to jmknoble.cx.  Added 2000 to copyright date.

	* x11-ssh-askpass.man.in: Added man page for x11-ssh-askpass from
	Matthieu Herrb <matthieu@laas.fr> of OpenBSD.

2000-08-28 05:31  jmknoble

	* README, SshAskpass-1337.ad, SshAskpass-NeXTish.ad,
	SshAskpass-default.ad, SshAskpass-green.ad, SshAskpass-motif.ad,
	dynlist.c, dynlist.h, x11-ssh-askpass.c, x11-ssh-askpass.h: Changed
	ISO-8859-1 copyright character '©' to ASCII '(C)'.

	* Imakefile: Portability enhancements to Imakefile, suggested by
	Charles Levert <charles@comm.polymtl.ca>.   Use imake's '...Cmd'
	macros where available; otherwise, use less-nonportable commands.
	
	Bumped version to 1.0.1.

	* x11-ssh-askpass.c: Oops.  When the keyboard or pointer grab
	failed, the fprintf() calls to print the error message were missing
	the 'reason' argument.	Thanks to Daniel Packman
	<pack@mop2.eos.ucar.edu>.

2000-01-07 09:52  jmknoble

	* Imakefile: Now we install the actual program as
	`x11-ssh-askpass', and make a symlink to that from `ssh-askpass'. 
	This allows for multiple passphrase dialogs on a system.
	
	Bumped version to 1.0.

	* README: Added note about location of x11-ssh-askpass.

1999-12-24 06:59  jmknoble

	* Imakefile: Oops.  Version backed out to 0.99; missing spec file
	for building RPMs.

1999-12-24 06:05  jmknoble

	* Imakefile: Updated version to 1.0.  Removed reference to utils.h.
	 Prefer install targets available in X11R6.

1999-12-24 05:56  jmknoble

	* resources.c, resources.h: Moved header includes from utils.h into
	resources.c.  Trimmed unused functions.

	* README: Updated install directory.  Removed reference to utils.h.

	* dynlist.c: Removed potential memory leak (and ensuing loss of
	buffer contents) if realloc() failed.

1999-12-24 05:53  jmknoble

	* utils.h: Moved header includes from here into resources.c.

1999-12-05 04:21  jmknoble

	* Imakefile: Added patch from Markus Friedl to change use of awk
	(with GNU-specific extensions?) to sed, more likely to be available
	on various platforms.

1999-11-23 10:14  jmknoble

	* .cvsignore: Added ChangeLog to .cvsignore.

	* Imakefile: Added facility for autogenerating ChangeLog using
	cvs2cl.

1999-11-23 09:53  jmknoble

	* .cvsignore: Added .cvsignore file.

	* Imakefile, SshAskpass-1337.ad, SshAskpass-NeXTish.ad,
	SshAskpass-default.ad, SshAskpass-green.ad, SshAskpass-motif.ad,
	x11-ssh-askpass.c, x11-ssh-askpass.h: - Added version to tarball. 
	- *grab(Keyboard|Pointer|Server) resources had inverted values in  
	app-defaults files.  - Futzed with spacing in default and NeXTish
	themes.  - Added setrlimit() call to main() to avoid core dumps.

	* .cvsignore, README, README.x11-ssh-askpass:
	README.x11-ssh-askpass moved to README.  Shorter.

1999-11-23 09:50  jmknoble

	* Imakefile, SshAskpass-1337.ad, SshAskpass-NeXTish.ad,
	SshAskpass-default.ad, SshAskpass-green.ad, SshAskpass-motif.ad,
	resources.c, resources.h, x11-ssh-askpass.c, x11-ssh-askpass.h: -
	Can optionally grab server (*grabServer resource, off by default). 
	- get_pixel_resource(), get_integer_resource() now take default
	value.	- Added minimum/maximum indicator count.  - memset()
	passphrase to 0s before freeing.  - Use fputs() instead of printf()
	to avoid possibility of passphrase   getting stored in dynamic
	memory by stdio.
