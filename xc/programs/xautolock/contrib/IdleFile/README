This is a modified version of xautolock (pl10) that optionally
makes the (approximate) time of the last input event available to
other programs.  This is done by setting the last access time on
a file of the user's choosing, analogous to the way UNIX terminal
devices traditionally record the time of last input.
The syntax for this is

	xautolock -idlefile /tmp/xidle

where /tmp/xidle is the (dummy) file being used for timestamping.
The filename given can be any file for which the users as permissions,
but it is typically used on the console device,

	xautolock -idlefile /dev/console

which causes xautolock to update the idle time that programs like
`finger' report for the workstation user.

The traditional locker function can be suppressed with
xautolock -locker NONE.  This is obviously useful in combination
with -idlefile to run xautolock as an 'idle time daemon.'
