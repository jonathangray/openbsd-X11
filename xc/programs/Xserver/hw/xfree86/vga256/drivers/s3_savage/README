This version of the s3 savage driver differs slightly from that
released by XFree86 in fix-08-s3savage_ix+mx.   The source came
from http://www.probo.com/timr/savagemx.html on Oct 8, 2000 and
includes some fixes not present in fix-08-s3savage_ix+mx.   Other
parts of fix-08-s3savage_ix+mx (e.g. SuperProbe changes) have been
incorporated into the OpenBSD source tree.

Some notes from http://www.probo.com/timr/savagemx.html by timr@probo.com 

    Known Issues

    Text Scrolling: Some users have reported a bus lock, requiring a power
    cycle to recover, during rapid text scrolling. This has been reported
    both in xterm and in the "Matrix" screen saver (xlock -mode matrix). I
    have not been able to duplicate this hang on my test system. As soon as
    I am able to reproduce it reliably, I will embark on a repair strategy.

    VT-Switching: There is a known issue when bringing down the server on
    non-Linux and non-x86 systems. I have some kind of a register timing or
    write-order problem that I have been unable to resolve. I was able to
    work around it by calling the video BIOS to switch to mode 3 before
    exiting the server, but the video BIOS code only works on Linux/x86. If
    you encounter screen hangs when killing the server, let me know, and let
    me know a little about your environment. Since the /MX and /IX were
    designed for laptops, I don't expect to get a lot of exposure in non-x86
    environments.

    Snow on FreeBSD at 32bpp: When the server is build for FreeBSD, the
    32-bit modes get "sparklies" on the screen during rapid activity. The
    snow is not intolerable, but it is annoying. I am working on this
    issue.

The "VT-Switching" and "Snow on FreeBSD at 32bpp" problems have also
been seen on OpenBSD.
