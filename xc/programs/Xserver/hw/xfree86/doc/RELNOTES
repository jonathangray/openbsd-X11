     This document describes the bugs fixed in XFree86 3.3.1 compared with
     the 3.3 release, as well as the new features in XFree86 3.3 compared
     with the previous full release, 3.2.  It also includes installation
     instructions for the binary distributions.



_1_.  _X_F_r_e_e_8_6 _a_n_d _X_1_1_R_6_._3

XFree86 releases starting with the 3.2A beta are based on the X Consortium's
X11R6.3 (the final release from the X Consortium).

R6.3 is an update to R6.1, and is intended to be compatible with R6.1 and R6 at
the source and protocol levels.	 Binaries should be upward-compatible.	X11R6.3
includes some new Xserver extensions: SECURITY, XC-APPGROUP, XpExtension (print
extension), and an updated, and standardised version of LBX.  X11R6.3 also has
new standards, including RX (X Remote Execution MIME type), and a proxy manage
ment protocol.	X11R6.3 includes support for gzipped fonts.

R6.1 is an update to R6, and is intended to be compatible with R6 at the source
and protocol levels.  Binaries should be upward-compatible.  X11R6.1 includes
some new Xserver extensions: DOUBLE-BUFFER, XKEYBOARD and RECORD.

What about R6.2?  X11R6.2 is the name given to a subset of X11R6.3, which has
only the print extension and the Xlib implementation of vertical writing and
user-defined character support in addition to those features included in R6.1.


_2_.  _O_S _i_s_s_u_e_s

Always check the OS specific README files for special requirements or caveats.

Users running Linux/Elf (on Intel platforms) should note that they will need
ld.so version 1.7.14 or later.	This can be found at
ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages/GCC.

Note: Elf is now the only binary type supported for Linux OSs.	This means that
binaries for ix86/a.out and AXP/ECOFF are not available with this release.

     been fixed.









Release Notes for XFree86 3.3.1



    A conflict between Imake.rules and Motif.rules has been fixed.

    Some problems that show up with some accelerated servers on SVR4 when
     using Xqueue have been fixed.

    A problem that can cause a server crash when drawing some arcs has been
     fixed.

    The MGA driver now recognises the newer 220MHz Mystique chips.

    The MGA driver has experimental support for the Millennium II.  This
     really is very new, and is largely untested.  There are known problems
     (see README.MGA for details).

    The "noaccel" option could cause a lockup with the Cirrus Laguna chips
     (546x).  This option is now disabled for those chips.

    Some blitter timeouts that show up with Cirrus 7548 and 7555 chips should
     now be fixed.

    The handling of the PS/2 mouse protocol is fixed for OpenBSD.

    The SiS driver should now correctly determine the MMIO address.

_3_._2  _K_n_o_w_n _P_r_o_b_l_e_m_s

    There are problems with some Cirrus laptop chipsets (75xx).	 The driver
     seems to work for some people, but not others.  Until someone with the
     appropriate hardware can look into this, these problems are unlikely to be
     fixed.  If you wish to work on this, please contact us.  We don't need
     testers, we need people willing and able to fix the problems.

    There are problems with some of the Trident laptop chipsets.  The driver
     seems to work in a limited way for some people, but not others.  Until
     someone with the appropriate hardware can look into this, these problems
     are unlikely to be fixed.	If you wish to work on this, please contact us.
     We don't need testers, we need people willing and able to fix the prob
     lems.

    We have had some reports of apparently random lockups with some Mystique
     cards.  We have not been able to reproduce this problem, and have no fix
     for it.

    There is a drawing bug in the MGA driver that shows up when running `view
     fax'.  We have no fix for this problem yet.

    Some people have reported problems with some newer Rage II cards.  We have
     no fix for this problem yet.

    We've had a report that the SVGA server will cause a lockup on some SVR4
     versions (UnixWare 1.x) with some Chips and Technologies chips.  A
     workaround for this problem is to use the "xaa_no_color_exp" option.

_4_._8  _S_V_G_A _s_e_r_v_e_r

    A new general graphics acceleration interface (XFree86 Acceleration Archi
     tecture - XAA) has been implemented.  It is used to provide relatively
     complete acceleration, at different colour depths, for several chips in
     the SVGA server.  Chips currently making use of this include the Matrox
     Millennium, Mystique, Tseng ET4000/W32p and ET6000, and several chips from
     ARK Logic, Chips and Technologies, Cirrus, Trident, SiS and the S3 ViRGE
     family.

    The SVGA server now includes a driver for the S3 ViRGE family. It supports
     the ViRGE, ViRGE/DX, ViRGE/GX and ViRGE/VX. This driver is a completely
     new implementation, so please send in success/failure reports.

_4_._9  _S_3 _s_e_r_v_e_r

    Some further S3 968 hardware bugs for lines/text have been worked around.

    Cursor/pointer pixmaps larger than 64x64 are now supported without the
     need to use the "sw_cursor" option.

    Detection/support for the Trio64UV+, Trio64V2 (including the /DX and /GX
     versions), Aurora64V+ (86CM65 used in notebooks), and Plato/PX is now
     included.	This support is very new and hasn't had much testing, so please
     send us success/failure reports.

    Support is now included for the ELSA Winner 2000PRO/X-8.  Please refer to
     the notes for this card in README.S3.

    Support is now included for the MIRO 80SV.










Release Notes for XFree86 3.3.1



    A bug which prevented DGA apps from setting the ViewPort to the lower part
     of the framebuffer has been fixed (this showed up most commonly with 4MB
     cards).

_4_._1_0  _S_3_V _(_V_i_R_G_E_) _s_e_r_v_e_r

    Problems with the Diamond Stealth 3D 3000 are now fixed.

    The line drawing code has been improved.

    Packed 24bpp support is included, and should be improved over earlier ver
     sions.

    The S3V server translates between sparse 32bpp pixmaps and packed 24bpp
     for the framebuffer.  In some cases this can be slow.

    32bpp framebuffer format is not supported.

_4_._1_1  _M_a_c_h_6_4 _s_e_r_v_e_r

    Support for 3D Rage II based Mach64 cards is included.

    Various problems with support for some revisions of CT, VT and GT chipsets
     have been fixed.

    It is strongly recommended that all users with CT, VT, GT and 3D Rage II
     based Mach64 cards upgrade to the 3.3 release due to the problems that
     were fixed.

_4_._1_2  _M_a_c_h_3_2 _s_e_r_v_e_r

    A bug that causes problems when running XF86Setup with cards with less
     than 2MB of video memory has been fixed.

    Minor shifts in maximum clock rate under 16 bpp, and inclusion of explicit
     15 "bpp" setting.

_4_._1_3  _W_3_2 _s_e_r_v_e_r

    In this version, the separate W32 server (XF86_W32) has not undergone any
     significant changes. In fact, it is not being developed further. Instead,
     the SVGA server (XF86_SVGA) is now the main focus of new developments. See
     the W32 (SVGA) description.

_4_._1_4  _P_9_0_0_0 _s_e_r_v_e_r

    More complete acceleration has been implemented using XAA, including line
     draw, fill, and text acceleration, at different colour depths.

_4_._1_9  _W_3_2 _d_r_i_v_e_r _(_S_V_G_A _s_e_r_v_e_r_)

    The SVGA server now supports acceleration for the most recent ET4000W32
     chips. In 3.3, the ET4000W32p chips are now fully accelerated, and also
     support the higher performing linear memory layout (read the tseng README
     file for more information: there are a few problems).

    VESA DPMS (monitor power saving) support was added.

    There is now support for more than 256 colors on most ET4000W32i and
     ET4000W32p chips. This means 15, 16, 24 and/or 32 bits per pixel modes
     (32768, 65536 or 16 million colors) are supported on most common RAMDACs.
     On the W32p, these modes are accelerated. On the W32i, there is no accel
     eration in any mode. For accelerated support on W32i chips, refer to the
     separate W32 server (XF86_W32).

    A few bugs in XFree86 3.2 and 3.2A have been fixed. Most importantly the
     failure to probe some PCI cards has been resolved.

    Fix interference with ISA-DMA sensitive devices (soundcards, floppy-tape
     drives)

    Support for the Chrontel RAMDAC has been added.

_4_._2_0  _E_T_6_0_0_0 _d_r_i_v_e_r _(_S_V_G_A _s_e_r_v_e_r_)

    The ET6000 driver in the separate W32 server (XF86_W32) has not changed
     significantly.








Release Notes for XFree86 3.3.1



    On the other hand, the ET6000 driver in the SVGA server, which already
     existed in XFree86 3.2 for all color depths, is now fully accelerated for
     all those color depths. It builds upon the new XAA architecture, which is
     the cornerstone of a new acceleration framework within the XFree86
     servers. It is responsible for the outstanding acceleration performance of
     this release.

    Many small problems which existed in the initial 3.2 release have been
     solved. Screen noise, flicker or instability at higher pixel clocks are
     mostly fixed. Some detection problems are gone. Weird behaviour (jumping
     and screen wrap) when panning through large virtual desktops has been
     fixed. The server now detects the correct amount of memory on ET6000 cards
     with 2.25 MB of MDRAM. More realistic pixel clock rate limits have been
     put in place, to avoid modes that would cause screen problems.

    DPMS support was added.

    The ET6000 hardware cursor is now supported. Read the Tseng documentation
     file for more information (there are a few limitations)

    fix interference with ISA-DMA sensitive devices (soundcards, floppy-tape
     drives)

Release Notes for XFree86 3.3.1



    The Compaq AVGA driver has been resurrected.  The bugs causing it to not
     work in some previous releases have been fixed.

    The problems with the Hercules mono driver in previous releases has now
     been fixed, and the driver is included in this release.

    The libraries have been updated to R6.3.  The shared lib version numbers
     for libXext and libICE have been bumped to 6.3.  The others remain the
     same.

    An Xlib problem with non-latin-1 encodings that shows up when using XKB is
     fixed.

    Some Xlib security vulnerabilities have been fixed.

    Xterm's emulation of DECUDK (DEC user-defined keys) now (correctly) inter
     prets shifted keys only.

    VT52 emulation has been added to xterm.

    Xterm's VT100 emulation generates correct codes for PF1-PF4, as well as
     the keypad "+" and ",".  These codes differ from the VT220 emulation.

    Some xterm bugs have been fixed, including coloured background exposure
     while selection is active, and missing state changes in the VT100 emula
     tion.

    Xterm's memory requirements for colour have been reduced.  The colour
     resource file is merged with the regular resource file to reduce installa
     tion problems.

    Emulation of VT220 soft-reset, and non-DEC REP (repeat) control sequence
     has been added to xterm.

    Xterm now recognizes control sequences for 16 colors (from aixterm).

    xset includes support for the DPMS extension.

    xset's "r rate" flag was broken on some OSs, and is now fixed.

     common modes available (85 and 100 Hz). 512x384, 1152x864, 1600x1200 and
     1800x1440 modes were added.

The XFree86 3.3.1 binaries are distributed as both a full release and as an
upgrade to XFree86 3.3.

What follows is a list of the XFree86 3.3.1 components.	 There may be some
variations in this for some OSs.

The following are required for all new installations or upgrades from versions
prior to 3.3:


	  preinst.sh	  Pre-installation script
	  postinst.sh	  Post-installation script
	  extract.tgz	  XFree86 extraction utility
	  X331bin.tgz	  Clients, run-time libs, and app-defaults files
	  X331doc.tgz	  Documentation
	  X331fnts.tgz	  75dpi, misc and PEX fonts
	  X331lib.tgz	  Data files required at run-time
	  X331man.tgz	  Manual pages
	  X331set.tgz	  XF86Setup utility
	  X331VG16.tgz	  16 colour VGA server (XF86Setup needs this server)


The following are required for an upgrade from XFree86 3.3:













Release Notes for XFree86 3.3.1



	  preinst.sh	  Pre-installation script
	  postinst.sh	  Post-installation script
	  extract.tgz	  XFree86 extraction utility
	  X331upd.tgz	  Changes since 3.3 (except the servers)
	  X331doc.tgz	  Documentation
	  X331set.tgz	  XF86Setup utility
	  X331VG16.tgz	  16 colour VGA server (XF86Setup needs this server)


The following is required for new installations, and optional for existing
installations:


	  X331cfg.tgz	  sample config files for xinit, xdm


NOTE: Be very careful about installing X331cfg.tgz over an existing installa
tion if you have customised your xinit and/or xdm config files.	 Installing
X331cfg.tgz will overwrite any existing files.	If you do have customised
files, there is no need to install X331cfg.tgz.

NOTE: The bitmap fonts distributed with this release are compressed using gzip
rather than compress.  This means that you will probably want to remove the old
versions (after backing them up).  The Xservers and font server in releases
prior to 3.2A cannot read gzipped fonts, so keep a copy of the old fonts if you
wish to run older servers.

The following X servers are for PC/AT based hardware (i.e., typical Intel ix86
based PCs).  Choose at least one which matches your hardware, as well as the
VGA16 server.  The VGA16 server is required by the new configuration utility
(XF86Setup).

If you already have a version of XFree86 installed, MMAAKKEE AA BBAACCKKUUPP OOFF /usr/X11R6
BBEEFFOORREE DDOOIINNGG AANNYYTTHHIINNGG EELLSSEE.  The standard installation procedure will overwrite
your existing version of XFree86.

If you are installing from scratch, create a directory called /usr/X11R6, then
extract the required .tgz files.  If you don't have enough space in /usr for
this, create a directory elsewhere and create a symbolic link to it.  E.g., if
you create a directory in /home:

	  mkdir /home/X11R6
	  ln -s /home/X11R6 /usr

The next step is to run the pre-installation script.  This script makes some
preliminary checks of your system.  For some OSs, it may tell you to install
new versions of some system components before proceeding with the installation.
This script may also remove some outdated files and symbolic links from a pre
vious installation that could cause problems.

For the purposes of these installation instructions, it is assumed that you
have downloaded all the files to the /var/tmp directory.  If you've put them in
another directory, that's fine -- just replace all occurrences of ``/var/tmp''
with the name of that directory.

To run the pre-installation script, go to /usr/X11R6 and run it:

	  cd /usr/X11R6
	  sh /var/tmp/preinst.sh

The next step is to untar the installation utility.  To do this, make sure the
extract.tgz file is in the same directory as all the X331*.tgz files, and run
the following from that directory:

	  cd /var/tmp
	  gzip -d < extract.tgz | tar vxf -

The installation utility ``extract'' is used to unpack the .tgz files that make
up the XFree86 distribution.  The .tgz files are gzipped tar files.  However,








Release Notes for XFree86 3.3.1



``tar'' in its standard form on most OSs is not well-suited to the task of
installing XFree86.  The extract utility is a modified version of GNU tar 1.12
built with the options required to make it suitable for installing XFree86.
The source for extract is available from the same place you got the XFree86
distribution.

It is strongly recommended that you use the provided extract utility to unpack
the XFree86 distribution.  If you choose to ignore this and use something else,
we don't want to hear from you if you run into problems.  It is also important
that you do not rename the extract utility.  If renamed, it behaves just like
the normal GNU tar.

To extract the XFree86 binaries, run the following as rroooott:

	  cd /usr/X11R6
	  /var/tmp/extract /var/tmp/X331*.tgz

Once the required .tgz files have been extracted, run the post installation
script:

	  cd /usr/X11R6
	  sh /var/tmp/postinst.sh

For OSs which use ldconfig, you may need to run ldconfig or reboot to complete
the installation.  The postinst.sh script should run ldconfig correctly for you
if you are using Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD or OpenBSD.  For other OSs that use
ldconfig, check how it normally gets run at boot time.
