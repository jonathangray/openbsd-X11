>>ASSERTION Good A
On a call to xname 
the image of each 8-bit character in the 
.A string,
as defined by the 
.M font set
is treated as an additional mask for a fill operation on the 
.A drawable .
>>STRATEGY
For each locales, for all fontsets, draw all the characters between 
0&255, by setting up strings to point to groups of characters at a time.  
Pixmap verify.  Only one Visual will be tested since XDrawString is being 
tested elsewhere.
